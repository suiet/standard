# Overview

Sui leverages an object-oriented model with the move programming language, every object in Sui has a unique address and represents a kind of asset, some of them are Fungible and others have NFT-like characteristics.
Suiet will display the NFT-like asserts on an individual tab, separate from Fungible tokens that show on the Home tab. With the intention to display users' assets properly in Suiet, we suggest this guideline to DEX, NFT marketplace & creators.

In the future we may support different scenario with different metadata structure, including 3D object, messages, etc. But for now, we will focus on some basic use cases.

## Fungible Token

- [Fungible Token Standard(WIP)](/ft/)

## Non-fungible token

- [NFT Standard](/nft/)
- [NFT Collection Standard](/nft/collections.md)
